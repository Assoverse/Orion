# Support

Thank you for using Orion! We provide the following support channels:

- **Documentation** – Start with the docs in the `docs/` directory. Architecture, API, and provider guides are kept up to date with each release.
- **Discussions** – Use GitHub Discussions (coming soon) for Q&A, brainstorming features, and sharing best practices.
- **Issues** – File bugs or feature requests using the issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`. Please provide logs, Orion version, runtime details, and reproduction steps.
- **Security** – Report vulnerabilities privately via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Commercial / Enterprise** – Contact `hello@assoverse.app` for enterprise support, custom SLAs, or consulting engagements.

We respond to community issues on a best-effort basis. For timely responses, please include all relevant context and logs. Pull requests that include failing scenarios with tests are especially welcome.
